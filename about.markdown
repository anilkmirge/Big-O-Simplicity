# Anil Mirge

A seasoned software expert who has developed products for enterprise clients. I believe in delivering the applications that makes an **impact!** while satisfying the business needs. Someone who loves programming, travelling, and blogging on everything related to computer science from Data Structures & Algorithms to DevOps.

Currently working as a Full Stack Developer & DevOps Engineer to build state of the art micro services with Spring Boot and React and doing continuous integration using Jenkins with Docker and Kubernetes.

I enjoy my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal passion for building amazing things, and my mission-driven work ethic to change the world. That's why Iâ€™m excited to make a big impact at a high growth company.
